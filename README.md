üç≥ Culinary Beginning:
My professional journey started in the vibrant world of culinary arts, where I worked as a Chef in various hotels and restaurants. 

üíª Pivot to Programming:
In a significant career shift fom February 2023, I started exploring the world of programming. Starting with the Helsinki Java MOOC, I not only completed the course but also earned a certification, signifying my commitment to this new field. My journey in tech didn't stop there; I've since learned tools and frameworks like GitHub, Spring/Spring Boot, and SQL, demonstrating my adaptability and eagerness to learn.

üîó A Fusion of Passions:
Currently, I am channeling my culinary background into the development of a food delivery application. This project symbolizes my transition from the culinary arts to the tech sector and epitomizes my ability to merge diverse skill sets.

üåü Future Goals:
As I look to the future, my primary goal is to deepen my understanding and expertise in Computer Science. This means not just enhancing what I've already learned but also about exploring new areas and innovations, continually evolving my skill set in this field.
